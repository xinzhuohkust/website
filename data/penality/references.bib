  abstract = {Well-known tools of state coercion, such as administrative punishment, imprisonment, and violence, affect far fewer than 1\% of Chinese journalists and lawyers.What, then, keeps the other 99\% in line? Building on work detailing control strategies in illiberal states, the authors suggest that the answer is more complicated than the usual story of heavy-handed repression. Instead, deep-rooted uncertainty about the boundaries of permissible political action magnifies the effect of each crackdown. Unsure of the limits of state tolerance, lawyers and journalists frequently self-censor, effectively controlling themselves. But self-censorship does not always mean total retreat from political concerns. Rather, didactic stories about transgression help the politically inclined map the gray zone between (relatively) safe and unacceptably risky choices. For all but the most optimistic risk takers, these stories—which we call control parables—harden limits on activism by illustrating a set of prescriptions designed to prevent future clashes with authority. The rules for daily behavior, in short, are not handed down from the pinnacle of the state but jointly written (and rewritten) by Chinese public professionals and their government overseers.},

  abstract = {China has witnessed numerous incidents of social protests over the past three decades. Protests create uncertainty for authoritarian governments, and the Chinese government has created, strengthened, and coordinated multiple dispute-resolution institutions to manage social conflicts and protests. Accommodating the aggrieved prevents the accumulation of grievances in society, but concessions require resources. As the frequency and scale of collective action are closely tied to the political opportunity for action, the Chinese government has also contained collective action by shaping the political opportunity available to the aggrieved. This Element shows that when the Chinese central government prioritizes social control, as it has under Xi Jinping’s leadership, it signals its preference for stricter social control, and that it will tolerate local governments’ use of coercion. As a result, the central and local governments create an environment that is not conducive to the mobilization of collective action. Although reactive collective actions have still occurred in China, large-scale occurrences have been uncommon in recent years.},
